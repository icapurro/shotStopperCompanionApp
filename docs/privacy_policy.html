<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p><strong>ShotStopper</strong> is a companion app for the ShotStopper Arduino board, an innovative <strong>brew-by-weight</strong> add-on for espresso machines. This app is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>

<p>This page informs users about our policies regarding data collection, usage, and permissions.</p>

<h3>Data Collection and Use</h3>
<p>ShotStopper <strong>does not</strong> collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>However, the app requires certain permissions to function properly, including access to Bluetooth and Location Services for connecting to the ShotStopper device.</p>

<h3>Location Data</h3>
<p>ShotStopper requests access to <strong>Location Services</strong> because Android requires it for scanning and connecting to Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Why is Location Required?</strong> Android requires Location Services to be enabled for BLE scanning, even though ShotStopper <strong>does not track or store</strong> your location.</li>
    <li><strong>Does ShotStopper Collect or Share Location Data?</strong> No. The app does not store, transmit, or use your location for any purpose other than enabling BLE communication.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Crash Logs and Analytics</h3>
<p>To improve app performance, ShotStopper may collect anonymized usage data and crash reports, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>App usage statistics (e.g., feature interactions)</li>
    <li>Crash logs (device model, OS version, error reports)</li>
</ul>
<p>This data is processed using third-party services such as Firebase or similar tools and does not include personally identifiable information.</p>

<h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
<p>We may use third-party services for crash reporting and analytics. These services have their own privacy policies regarding data collection and processing.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>
<p>We take reasonable measures to ensure that any collected data remains secure and is used solely to improve the app experience. However, no method of electronic transmission is 100% secure.</p>

<h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
<p>ShotStopper does not knowingly collect data from children under the age of 13.</p>

<h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page.</p>
