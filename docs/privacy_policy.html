<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p><strong>ShotStopper</strong> is developed as a companion app for a hardware device. This app is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>

<p>This page is used to inform users about our policies regarding data collection and usage.</p>

<p><strong>Data Collection and Use</strong></p>
<p>ShotStopper does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information. The app operates locally on your device and solely communicates with the paired hardware device via Bluetooth.</p>

<p>However, to improve the app's performance and stability, we may collect anonymized usage analytics and crash reports. This information is used solely for debugging and enhancing the user experience.</p>

<p><strong>Crash Logs and Analytics</strong></p>
<p>ShotStopper may collect and transmit non-personal data such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>App usage statistics (e.g., feature interactions)</li>
    <li>Crash logs, including error reports, device model, operating system version, and app version</li>
</ul>
<p>This data is collected using third-party services, such as Google Firebase or similar analytics tools, to help diagnose issues and improve the app. No personally identifiable information is included in these reports.</p>

<p><strong>Third-Party Services</strong></p>
<p>We may use third-party services to process crash logs and usage analytics. These services have their own privacy policies regarding data collection and processing.</p>

<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>We take reasonable measures to ensure that any data collected is secure and used only for improving the app. However, no transmission over the internet is 100% secure.</p>

<p><strong>Children's Privacy</strong></p>
<p>ShotStopper does not knowingly collect data from children under the age of 13. Since no personal information is collected, there is no risk of exposure.</p>

<p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p>
